# IC Tester And Identifier

In this project I tried to build a device using **Arduino Mega**. I use Mega as a brain of the device and breadboard to connect all other necessery components like keypad (for user input), display (to show the result) via jumper wires. First I do code in computer and push it to the arduino. After all the components connected , we have to supply the power to start the device. Now we have to place the IC on the breadboard in appropriate position. Now user interaction must be needed to further computation.

## Flow chart 📌

## Complexity 🔖

**Manual test complexity: O(1)**. The user enters the IC number using the keypad 
into the device and the device directly checks for that particular IC in the 
provided IC list. If that particular IC number is present in the IC list, then the 
device checks for the condition of the logic gate(s) present in the corresponding 
IC. 

**Self-test complexity: O(n)**. In this situation, user does not enter the IC number,
so the device checks the particular IC behaviour and tries to match with the 
enlisted IC behaviours one by one. If the IC list contains ‘n’ number of ICs,
then in the worst situation the device has to check all the IC behaviours present 
in the IC list to determine the testing IC.

## Features 
- Works fast 
- It can show result depend on individual gates present in a IC
- Automate testing 

## Drawbaks
- While testing automatically some time it stops working due to low memory.


## Result 🚀

We tried some ICs (7400,7404,7408...etc) on this device.

### Simulation result

First we tried our algorithm in proteous before build the device physically.
Here are some result -
